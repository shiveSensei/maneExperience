//Backend changes
Updated login function to take wnum/pw, insted of email/pw. 
Added a function for the user to change his/her password(User.updatePw). updatePw checks if user exists before it changes the pw. This keeps from adding dups/erronious additions to db. Route for using this has been added as well (/updateUser).
